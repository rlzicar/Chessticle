# Chessticle

A minimalist multiplayer chess game made with Unity and Photon Unity Networking 2 (PUN 2).

Chessticle implements most of the chess rules, including castling, promotion and under-promotion, en passant captures, the threefold repetition rule and the fifty-move rule. The time control is 10+0.
